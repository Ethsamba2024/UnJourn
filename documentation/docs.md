## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements are detailed specifications of the operations and functionalities that a software system must perform to meet user needs and project objectives. They describe what the system should do, defining user actions, system operations, and relevant constraints, providing an essential foundation for system design, development, and testing, as well as for validating that it meets established criteria.

User stories are a fundamental component of agile software development, serving as concise descriptions of specific pieces of functionality from a user's perspective. Typically written in a simple, structured format, a user story outlines who the user is, what they want, and why they want it. This framework helps the teams to understand the user's needs and prioritize work, fostering collaboration and flexibility in delivering software that aligns with customer requirements.
